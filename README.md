This project allows you to cache the compilation on Unreal Engine building (like ccache).

It speeds up recompilation by caching previous compilations and detecting when the same compilation is being done again.

## Integration

### Unreal Engine
This project allows you to cache the compilation on Unreal Engine building (like ccache).

It's supported out of box (you need simply install it):

 * Visual Studio UBT build on Windows;
 * clang UBT build on Linux.

This program uses UBT extension point for IncrediBuild.

### MSBuild
You need to add lines to begin of prject file:
```xml
<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <Import Condition="Exists('$(OCTOBUILD)/msbuild/octobuild.targets')" Project="$(OCTOBUILD)/msbuild/octobuild.targets" />
  ...
</Project>
```

In this case you will use octobuild only if it installed. Without installed octobuild you will have usual build.

## Installation

### Windows 10
You can install octobuild by PowerShell commands:
```ps1
# First, you have to set the execution policy to allow scripts, otherwise it'll silently fail
# while reporting success (https://github.com/OneGet/oneget/issues/97#issuecomment-139331418):
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
# Add package source
Register-PackageSource -Name bozaro -Provider Chocolatey -Location https://www.myget.org/F/bozaro/
# Install package
Install-Package octobuild
```

### Chocolatey
Chocolatey installation:
```bat
rem Add chocolatey source
choco sources add -name bozaro -source https://www.myget.org/F/bozaro/

rem Install package
choco install octobuild
```

### Ubuntu/Debian

You can install octobuild by commands:
```bash
# Add package source
echo "deb https://dist.bozaro.ru/ debian/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dist.bozaro.ru.list
curl -s https://dist.bozaro.ru/signature.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
# Install package
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install octobuild
```

## Configuration files

You can get configuration files and show default and actual configuration by running ```xgConsole``` without parameters.

## Known issues

On Windows you can't mix compilation with and without octobuild.

## Unreal Engine patches

This project require some patches for Unreal Engine:

 * [#1789](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/pull/1789) Allow use xgConsole on Linux (merged to 4.11)
